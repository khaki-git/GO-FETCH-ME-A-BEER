# GO-FETCH-ME-A-BEER
GO-FETCH-ME-A-BEER (GFMAB) is a groundbreaking open source website ready for any lazy parent in the Spa to use.  
GFMAB allows you to get your children to get you a beer at any location, time or situation.  
Here are some of the amazing reviews for GFMAB.  
  
*"Truly heart-touching and incredible" - John Beer, inventor of Beer*  
*"It cured my HIV which I had for the past 10 years" - John HIV, patient zero.*  
*"I've had more reason to beat my son than ever now." - Peter Parker, pizza guy*  
  
If that isn't enough to convince you to use GFMAB, then I don't know what will.
